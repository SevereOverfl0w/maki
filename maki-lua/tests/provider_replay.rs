//! The bundled provider plugins: the declaration each one authors, and the
//! recorded exchanges each one replays.
//!
//! maki writes every ported provider twice, once in Rust and once as a plugin
//! bundled in the binary, and the bundled one outranks the other at every real
//! startup. Two things follow. The two declarations have to agree, which for a
//! provider with no hooks at all is the whole story. And the plugin as shipped
//! has to replay the same recorded exchanges maki's own authoring is pinned
//! to: the goldens live over in `maki-providers` next to the artifacts, both
//! authorings assert against those same files, and neither reading dies when
//! the other one is deleted.
//!
//! Recorded on loopback, which is what `<SLUG>_BASE_URL` points at here. The
//! plugins declare their real hosts and nothing else, so reaching the recorded
//! server is the same widening a user with a gateway relies on.
//!
//! The registry, the environment and `providers.toml` are all process wide, so
//! every test boots its own host and counts on `cargo nextest` giving each test
//! a process of its own.
